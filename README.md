USED PROMPTS

1.-Create an initial setup with its respective folders and files of a website using react and npm to run in the host

2.- Implement a function in the main interface to allow users to add a new recipe.
The recipe should include ingredients and preparation steps.
After submission, show a confirmation message.
Allow the user to undo the action (e.g., with an "Undo" button or snackbar).
 Save the recipe data to persistent storage and ensure it remains accessible.

3.-create a css to make the wbsite prettier, remove the example text and create a header and a title (RecipeMe), instead of the ingridients being a string, make so that the user can save multiple ingridients as single strings


4.-Implement a search function in the main interface that allows users to search recipes
by name or ingredient. Display matching recipes in real time or on submit.
Allow the user to undo the search filter or selection if needed.
Show a confirmation or feedback message after the search.
Ensure all data remains correctly stored and accessible.

5.-write code for a pretty interface with cooking related themes

6.-Implement a function in the main interface that allows users to edit an existing recipe.
 The user should be able to modify ingredients and steps.
Show a confirmation message after changes are saved.
Include an undo option to revert to the previous version.
 Save updated recipe data persistently and make sure it's accessible later.

7.-write code so that when writing the recipie ingreients and steps, pressing enter also adds the ingredient or step. also, allow for quantity in the ingredients


8.-Implement a delete function in the main interface to let users remove a recipe.
 Prompt for confirmation before final deletion.
 After deletion, show a message confirming the action.
 Provide an option to undo the deletion within a short time.
 Ensure that remaining data is saved and accessible.
